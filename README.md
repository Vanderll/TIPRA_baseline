**2 Analyses Performed**
These are based on 2 different types of outcomes: either a continuous abundance measure or a negative/positive call based being +3SD above the mean level in the control group.  

1. ACPA abundance levels: TIP-RA_baseline_forPaper.v2

2. ACPA negative/positive: TIP-RA_baseline_forPaper.21July2022

**Data** Data used in these analyses are posted on this respository under the name: "TIPRA_baseline_ACPApeptideAssay.csv"

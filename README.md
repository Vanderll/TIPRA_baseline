This respository is code for the **ACPA array results** in the manuscript entitled **"Multifaceted Immune Dysregulation in Potentially Modifiable Pathways Characterizes Individuals At-Risk for Rheumatoid Arthritis"** 

**2 Analyses Performed**
These are based on 2 different types of outcomes: either a continuous abundance measure or a negative/positive call based being +3SD above the mean level in the control group.  

1. ACPA abundance levels: Code_forSupplementTable4and6

2. ACPA negative/positive: Code_forSupplementTables5and7

**Data** Data used in these analyses are posted on this respository under the name: "SourceData_SupplementalTables7and8.csv"

"SourceData_SupplementalTables7and8_vBP.csv" is the same data as above, but contains an additional variable called "MethylationLabId" that links this data to the DNA methylation data posted on GEO: GSE230446. 

Please see "dataDictionary.xlsx" for descriptions of all variables in dataset.
